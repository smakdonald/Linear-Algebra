<div class="para">One of the primary focuses of your first linear algebra course was, almost certainly, the solution of systems of linear equations, using techniques such as row reduction and back substitution. We won't recap these algorithms, though there are exercises designed to refresh your memory about the basic issues. Instead we want to present here a broader perspective on what was going on when you were solving such problems.</div>
