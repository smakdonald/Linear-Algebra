<div class="para">As we mentioned at the start, linear algebra connects algebra and geometry, so we'd like to make a connection between these two descriptions. Let's start by thinking about the vertical line through <span class="process-math">\((3,0)\text{.}\)</span> This is all the points whose <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> coordinate is <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> or, in other words, all the points whose distance in the direction of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis is <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> Similarly the horizontal line through <span class="process-math">\((0,7)\)</span> consists of all the points in the plane whose vertical distance from the origin is <span class="process-math">\(7\text{.}\)</span> Let's try to generalize this notion of “distance along an axis”.</div>
