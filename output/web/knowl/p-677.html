<div class="para">Though this theorem appears to completely answer the question of the simplest form of the matrix of an linear map (and in a beautiful way) it is actually substantially less valuable than it appears at first sight. The most natural cases of linear maps come from <span class="process-math">\(L(V,V)\text{;}\)</span> linear maps from a space to itself. For these we want to think about only one basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> that is, we want to have <span class="process-math">\(B=B'\text{,}\)</span> and use that basis to express both the input vector <span class="process-math">\(\v\)</span> and the output vector <span class="process-math">\(T(\v)\text{.}\)</span> It turns out the simple form in cannot always be achieved for <span class="process-math">\([T]_B^B\text{.}\)</span> This leads us into deeper waters, which we explore in this chapter.</div>
