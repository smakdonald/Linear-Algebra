<div class="para">Looking at <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "fig:add" missing or not unique]</code> we see that if we pick an axis the measure of “distance along that axis” is <em class="emphasis">additive</em>: the answer for the sum of two vectors is the sum of the answers for each individually. In other words, letting <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> be the axis, we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(\text{distance of $\u$ along $L$})+(\text{distance of $\v$ along $L$}) = (\text{distance of $\u+\v$ along $L$}).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">It's more obvious that if we scale a vector by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> say, then the distance along the axis scales by the same factor. So, if <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is any real number, we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
c\,(\text{distance of $\u$ along $L$})=(\text{distance of $c\,\u$ along $L$}).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Again, using a bit of trigonometry, we have that the length of <span class="process-math">\(\u\)</span> in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is just the length of <span class="process-math">\(\u\)</span> times <span class="process-math">\(\cos(\theta)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> is the (non-obtuse) angle between <span class="process-math">\(\u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>
