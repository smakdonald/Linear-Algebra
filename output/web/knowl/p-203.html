<div class="para">In <a href="sec-geometry.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Geometry">SectionÂ 1.2</a> we alluded to the fact that the solutions to a linear equation in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> form a plane. In we'll see why this is so. Once we know that each equation defines a plane in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> we see the set of solutions to the system is the set of all points lying on all three planes, that is, the intersection of the three planes. We anticipate that unless there is something special about these planes (such as two of them being parallel) the three planes should have exactly one common point.</div>
