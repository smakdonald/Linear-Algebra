<div class="para">There is an electronic game called Lights Out released by Tiger Toys in 1995. The game board consists of twenty-five lights in a <span class="process-math">\(5\by 5\)</span> grid. Pushing any of the lights causes that light to switch state (from on to off or <em class="emphasis">vice versa</em>) and also causes all the lights in the same row or column as the one being pushed to switch state. One is presented with a pattern of lights, and the objective is to press some of the lights so as to switch all the lights off.</div>
