<div class="para">The rational numbers <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> are a field, indeed they are a subfield of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> (simply meaning that <span class="process-math">\(\Q\of \R\)</span> and the field operations for <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> are the same whether you think of elements of <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> as rational numbers or real numbers). This fact means that conditions A1-A2, M1-M2, and C1 are trivially satisfied, since they're true for real numbers, not just rationals. Since the special real numbers <span class="process-math">\(0,1\)</span> are in fact in <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> we also get A3, M3, and C2 for free. This only leaves A4 and M4; given <span class="process-math">\(x\in \Q\)</span> we know that there are real numbers <span class="process-math">\(-x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\inv\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x+(-x)=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(xx\inv=1\text{,}\)</span> but what we need to know is that there are rational numbers with these properties <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Fortunately it is that case that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational then so are <span class="process-math">\(-x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\inv\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> is a field.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-fields.html#example-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
