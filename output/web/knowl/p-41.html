<div class="para">There's one more crucial ingredient to linear algebra that we need to introduce at this point. Geometry isn't just about points and lines and planesâ€”it's also about operations on such things, such as rotations and reflections. The core of linear algebra at this level is the study of vector spaces and <em class="emphasis">linear maps</em>. These are functions between vector spaces that respect addition and scaling of vectors. Let's see some examples.</div>
