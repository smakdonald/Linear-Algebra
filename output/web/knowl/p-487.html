<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\((V_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> is a family of vector spaces over a field <span class="process-math">\(\F\text{.}\)</span> We would like to exhibit a vector space <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> that contains (copies of) each of the <span class="process-math">\(V_i\)</span> without assuming that they are subspaces of the same vector field to begin with. Since <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span>contains the <span class="process-math">\(V_i\)</span> it must of course also contain linear combinations of vector from the <span class="process-math">\(V_i\text{.}\)</span> We will arrange that these linear combinations cannot “accidentally” produce any sort of cancellation. In particular for instance we want it to be the case that if <span class="process-math">\(\v\in V_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\w\in V_j\)</span> then the only way to have <span class="process-math">\(\v+\w=\0\)</span> is for each of <span class="process-math">\(\v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\w\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(\0\text{.}\)</span>
